# Luke Hevey Portfolio


## Description
The purpose of this project was to test the understanding of HTML and CSS, while also creating a portfolio. This portfolio will allow for projects to be showcased, information for contacting me, and information about me. I was challenged by the difficulty of this project and will continue correcting it the more I learn. This project has taught me a lot and will continue to be improved.
